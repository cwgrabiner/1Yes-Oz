# Signature Tool: Resume Makeover Framework

## Tool Name
**Signature Tool – Resume Transformation Framework**

## Core Insight
> “A great résumé doesn’t list what you did. It proves the impact you made.”

Most people think a résumé is a biography — it’s not. It’s a marketing document designed to earn one outcome: an interview. The goal is to make it effortless for a recruiter to see your value in 15 seconds or less. Melissa’s approach takes a résumé from dense and discouraging to skimmable, quantifiable, and impossible to ignore.

## Purpose
To help job seekers create résumés that **get noticed fast**, pass Applicant Tracking Systems (ATS), and **clearly communicate measurable impact** — all while restoring confidence in the person behind the document.

## Framework or Steps

### 1. Start From the Top — Literally
Begin with a **Professional Summary**, not an objective or a “Career Summary.”  
This short paragraph captures the totality of your experience, voice, and value. It should sound like a human wrote it — clear, confident, and results-driven.

### 2. Add 12–15 Core Competencies
Use this section like a visual snapshot of your skills.  
Keep them in a simple, ATS-friendly list (not a chart or sidebar). Focus on **hard skills and quantifiable strengths**, not soft, vague words like “relationship management.”

### 3. Prioritize Experience and Results
List experience from **most recent to oldest**.  
Use **7–12 bullet points per role**, putting the most impactful achievements first.  
Every bullet should start with a strong verb and, where possible, include a **quantifiable result** (“Reduced loan cycle from 45 days to 30,” not “Responsible for loan process improvements”).

### 4. Make It ATS-Friendly
Avoid boxes, graphs, emojis, or fancy colors that confuse tracking systems.  
Keep formatting simple: clean fonts, clear section headers, and no unnecessary design elements.

### 5. Place Education Intelligently
For most clients, education belongs at the bottom.  
Only new graduates or those with minimal experience should lead with education.  
Never highlight incomplete degrees — omit them or phrase them carefully if asked.

### 6. Tell a Story That Lifts You Up
A résumé should **sound like a story of progress**, not a list of duties.  
Each role should reflect your evolution and impact — what changed because you were there.

## Do / Don’t Table

| ✅ Do | ❌ Don’t |
|-------|----------|
| Lead with a concise **Professional Summary** | Use “Career Summary” or lengthy intros |
| Include **quantifiable achievements** | List duties or vague responsibilities |
| Keep layout **clean and ATS-safe** | Add boxes, graphics, emojis, or charts |
| Use **strong action verbs** | Start bullets with “Responsible for…” |
| List **core competencies** in plain text | Hide skills in sidebars or tables |
| Focus on **impact and outcomes** | Emphasize irrelevant or old experience |
| End with **education** (most cases) | Lead with school info if you’re experienced |

## Example Transformations

| Before | After |
|--------|-------|
| *Career Summary:* Six bullet points describing experience in management and finance. | *Professional Summary:* “Finance leader with 15+ years driving operational efficiency and reducing loan processing times by 30% across multi-site teams.” |
| Sidebar list of 15 skills, half soft skills. | Core Competencies section with 12 targeted hard skills under the summary. |
| Blue box header with heavy fonts and awkward layout. | Clean header with name, city/state, phone, email, and LinkedIn URL — no boxes or color blocks. |
| “Reduced loan process from 45 days to 30 days” buried mid-page. | Top bullet under first role, highlighting measurable impact immediately. |
| Lists “Professional Development – Purdue University (No degree)” | Omit incomplete degree entirely; ready to discuss verbally if asked. |

## Hidden Insight
> “When someone says they hate their résumé, what they really hate is how unseen they feel.”

Melissa’s deeper work isn’t just about formatting — it’s about restoring pride. A strong résumé reminds people they *have* achieved something meaningful. It’s an act of rebuilding confidence through language and proof.

## Client Action Steps

1. Gather your past roles and list 3–4 measurable achievements for each.  
2. Write a 3–4 sentence Professional Summary capturing who you are today.  
3. Build your Core Competencies list (12–15 hard skills).  
4. Format for clarity — one column, consistent spacing, clean fonts.  
5. Read your résumé out loud; if it sounds stiff, humanize it.  
6. Remember: your résumé is not your worth. It’s a marketing tool designed to get you one thing — a **conversation**.
