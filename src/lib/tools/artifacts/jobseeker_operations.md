# Signature Tool: Applications & Search Operations

## Tool Name
**Signature Tool – Search Ops & Applications Tracker**

## Core Insight
> “Treat your job search like a pipeline: people first, portals second—and track everything.”

Most searches stall from chaos, not capability. When you organize your targets, systematize outreach, and bias toward conversations, you create momentum. The hidden job market rewards the proactive and the consistent.

---

## Purpose
Give job seekers a clear, repeatable operating system for applications and outreach—so you stay organized, work the hidden market, and turn activity into offers without burning out.

---

## Framework or Steps
1. **Build a Target Map (15–30 Companies)**
   - Start **big → mid → boutique** in your industry (e.g., JPMorgan → Fifth Third → local boutique firm). Add companies you admire *and* lesser‑known gems.
   - Use LinkedIn, Google, and AI to discover firms you’ve never heard of; your network’s employers are a great seed list.

2. **Prioritize the People (Warm → Cold)**
   - Identify likely hiring managers, team leaders, and Talent Acquisition for each target.
   - Prefer warm intros (2nd‑degree paths). If none, do a short, specific cold outreach with your resume attached.

3. **Work the Hidden Job Market**
   - Many companies don’t post roles to avoid thousands of applicants; they source directly via LinkedIn/search firms.
   - Proactive note example (no public posting): “If you’re expanding X, here’s how I can help…” + resume attached.

4. **Track Like Ops (Use Teal or a Simple Sheet)**
   - Tools: **Teal** is excellent; a clean spreadsheet works too.
   - Minimum columns: Company, Role/Team, Req #/Link, Contact(s), Outreach Method, **Date Sent**, **Follow‑Up Date**, Status, Next Step, Notes.
   - The point isn’t fancy—**it’s consistency.**

5. **80/20 Time Split**
   - ~**80% networking** (intros, referrals, informational calls), **20% applying**.
   - Expect that most offers—especially at senior levels—come via people, not portals.

6. **Daily/Weekly Cadence**
   - **Daily (45–60 min):** 2–3 thoughtful touches, check replies, log next steps.
   - **Weekly:** 10 touches, 2 live conversations (coffee/Zoom), 1 value‑add comment/post showing your expertise.
   - **Shutdown rule:** Close the laptop by evening; protect sleep and movement.

7. **Search Firms (Selective)**
   - Partner with reputable retained/contingent firms in your domain. Remember: they work for the **company**, not the candidate—but placements are their business.
   - If a firm calls, take it. Also make a short list and introduce yourself proactively.

8. **Application Quality > Quantity**
   - Tailor summary + top bullets to the JD; align keywords naturally.
   - Follow the company page and reference the role/req in your outreach to humans.

9. **Review & Iterate (Every Friday)**
   - What created replies? Double down there (channel, message, titles).
   - Advance each live pipeline one step (intro → hiring manager → panel → offer). Archive quiet threads guilt‑free after two touches.

## Do / Don’t Table
| ✅ Do | ❌ Don’t |
|------|----------|
| Treat the search like a pipeline you actively manage. | Rely on memory and “inbox archaeology.” |
| Lead with warm intros; use concise cold notes when needed. | Ask vaguely for “a job” or send a wall of text. |
| Track dates, follow‑ups, and status for every touch. | Spray applications without logging anything. |
| Spend ~80% of time on people (networking). | Spend all week refreshing job boards. |
| Use Teal or a simple sheet you’ll actually maintain. | Over‑engineer a complex tracker you’ll abandon. |
| Close laptop by evening; protect energy. | Grind 12 hours/day until you burn out. |
| Partner with search firms strategically. | Assume search firms exist to place *you* personally. |

---

## Example Transformations
| Before | After |
|--------|-------|
| Random bookmarking with no plan. | Target list of 25 (big → mid → boutique) with named managers + TA, logged in Teal. |
| “Hi—any openings?” | “Hi Christine—admire the work at **[Firm]**. 8 yrs TA; built biotech pipelines without job posts. If you’re expanding TA capacity, I’d love a brief chat. **Resume attached.**” |
| Apply to dozens, wait in silence. | Warm intros first; cold note to hiring manager + follow company page; one polite follow‑up at day 7. |
| Endless scrolling every night. | Daily 45‑min block + Friday review; laptop closed by evening. |

## Hidden Insight (optional)
> “Quiet companies hire, too.” Many great teams never post. Your proactive note can be the difference between *no listing* and *new offer.*

---

## Client Action Steps
1. **Create Target Map:** List 25 companies (10 dream, 10 realistic, 5 boutique). Add likely managers + TA.
2. **Set Up Tracker:** Use **Teal** or a spreadsheet with the columns above. Add 10 records today.
3. **Draft Outreach:** Write 3 short templates (warm intro forwardable, cold to hiring manager, cold to TA). Attach resume.
4. **Block Cadence:** Calendar **45–60 min daily** networking + **Friday review**. Respect the shutdown rule.
5. **Search Firms:** Identify 3–5 in your niche; send a concise intro with focus areas and wins.
6. **Measure Weekly:** Count touches, replies, live chats, and advances. Tune messaging based on what gets responses.
7. **Pipeline Hygiene:** After two unanswered touches, archive and replace with a fresh target.
