# Signature Tool: Salary & Offer Negotiation

## Tool Name
**Signature Tool – Confident Negotiation Playbook**

## Core Insight
> “Most companies expect you to negotiate—and they budget for it. If you don’t ask, you don’t get.”

Most people hate asking for money—let’s fix that. Offers usually have wiggle room, and a calm, professional ask won’t make the offer disappear. Negotiate from a written offer, know your must‑haves, and remember: total comp is bigger than base.

---

## Purpose
Give you a simple, respectful process to negotiate for more—cash, time, equity, or benefits—without burning bridges or spiraling with fear.

---

## Framework or Steps
1. **Mindset First**
   - Companies assume the finalist will negotiate. It’s standard business, not greed.
   - Never accept in the moment; ask for **24 hours** to review.

2. **Get It in Writing**
   - Verbal offers are not the finish line. Request the **written offer** and full benefits packet before deciding.

3. **Know Your Total Comp**
   - Look beyond base: **bonus target, RSUs/stock options**, PTO, insurance contributions, life insurance, **401(k) match**, start date, WFH, and title/level.

4. **Pick Your Number & Floor**
   - Identify the **number you’ll gladly accept** and the **minimum you’ll take**. Anchor with market data and the role’s posted range if available.

5. **Make the First Ask (Short & Gracious)**
   - Script: “Thank you—I’m excited about the role. Based on the scope and market data, I was targeting **$X** base. If that’s tough, I’d love to discuss alternatives like **+1 week PTO** or a **sign‑on**.”

6. **Use Levers, Not Just Base**
   - If base is tight: ask for **sign‑on bonus**, **extra PTO**, **earlier review/raise timeline**, **level/title**, **remote/hybrid**, or **education budget**.

7. **Sequence & Timing**
   - Negotiate **after** you have the written offer. Review totals, choose levers, then counter once—follow with one thoughtful clarification if needed.

8. **Counteroffers from Your Current Employer**
   - **Decline them.** Most who accept **leave within ~6 months** anyway. If they can suddenly pay more, they could have valued you sooner.

9. **Decision Check**
   - Consider your runway, the work you’ll do, growth path, manager, and culture. A small cut may stall your earnings recovery for years.

10. **Close with Confidence**
   - If they meet you: accept warmly and confirm in writing. If not: decide quickly—in or out—so you can move forward.

## Do / Don’t Table
| ✅ Do | ❌ Don’t |
|------|----------|
| Ask for 24 hours and get the full offer **in writing**. | Accept on the spot out of anxiety. |
| Lead with appreciation and a clear, specific ask. | Apologize, over‑explain, or sound adversarial. |
| Negotiate **total comp** (bonus, RSUs, PTO, perks). | Fixate only on base salary. |
| Reference the posted range/market data when relevant. | Make a huge ask far above the discussed range at the last minute. |
| Counter once, then clarify; keep it short. | Send a long, emotional essay or multiple daily emails. |
| Decline counteroffers to stay at your current company. | Assume a counteroffer means long‑term satisfaction. |
| Decide using both money **and** role fit/growth. | Take a big pay cut that’s hard to recover from. |

## Example Transformations
| Before | After |
|--------|-------|
| “Okay, I accept!” (on the call) | “Thrilled about the offer—may I review the written details and benefits? I’ll follow up within 24 hours.” |
| “Can you do more money?” | “Given the scope, I’m targeting **$125K** base. If that’s difficult, could we explore a **$7.5K sign‑on** or **+1 week PTO**?” |
| Candidate never negotiated due to fear. | Candidate asked for +$10K to align with previous minimum; company **matched +$10K** and closed happily. |
| Current employer countered with a surprise raise. | Candidate thanked them, declined the counter, and joined the new role with a fair package and cleaner start. |

## Hidden Insight (optional)
> “Negotiation signals confidence and clarity. When done well, it builds trust instead of breaking it.”

## Client Action Steps
1. **Numbers:** Write down your **ideal**, **target**, and **floor** base; list 3 non‑base levers you’d value.
2. **Script:** Draft your 3‑sentence ask (base + two alternatives). Practice out loud once.
3. **Packet Review:** Request the **written offer** and full benefits; total it on one page.
4. **Email the Ask:** Send your script within 24 hours of receiving the written offer.
5. **Follow‑Up:** If needed, one concise follow‑up in 2 business days.
6. **Decision:** Use a quick checklist (money, role, team, growth, commute/WFH). Decide and confirm in writing.
7. **Decline Counteroffers:** Thank your current employer and stay the course—you’re choosing long‑term fit over short‑term relief.
