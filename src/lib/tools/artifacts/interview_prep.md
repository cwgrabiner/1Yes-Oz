## Purpose
This tool helps job seekers replace anxiety with confidence by teaching a structured approach to interview preparation — from researching the company to mastering behavioral questions to handling salary discussions like a pro.

## Framework or Steps

### 1. Research Like a Pro (30-Minute Minimum)
Spend at least 30 minutes studying:
- The company website and LinkedIn page  
- Competitors, customers, and recent news  
- Leadership bios and their latest posts  
**Why it matters:** Recruiters always know who’s done their homework.

### 2. Know Your Story Cold
Understand your résumé inside and out. Be ready to talk about every bullet point with examples.  
**Pro tip:** If you have to “refresh” your memory during the interview, you’re underprepared.

### 3. Master the STAR Method
Use the **Situation, Task, Action, Result** formula to describe your experiences.  
> “Past behavior is the best predictor of future performance.”  
Prepare at least three strong STAR stories that align with the job description.

### 4. Align With the Job Description
Go line by line through the posting and connect your background to each requirement.  
Show you’re not just qualified — you’re a perfect fit.

### 5. Handle Curveballs and Case Questions
For scenario-style prompts (“What would you do if…”), stay grounded in truth and logic.  
Draw from real examples rather than hypotheticals whenever possible.

### 6. Control the Salary Conversation
- If possible, have the company state the range first.  
- Ask: “Can you share the range for this role?”  
- Remember: Total compensation includes benefits, RSUs, bonuses, PTO, and 401(k) match — not just base pay.  
Know your threshold and be ready to walk if it’s below your value.

### 7. Manage Nerves Like a Pro
- Treat the interview as a **two-way conversation** — not an interrogation.  
- Exercise, walk, or meditate beforehand.  
- Stay hydrated and skip heavy caffeine.  
- Remind yourself: “They’d be lucky to have me.”

## Do / Don’t Table

| ✅ Do | ❌ Don’t |
|-------|----------|
| Spend 30+ minutes researching the company | Walk in without knowing what the company does |
| Know your résumé and STAR stories cold | Wing it or embellish your experience |
| Ask smart questions about culture and growth | Act like you’re being tested |
| Treat the interview as a two-way street | Give away all the power or sound desperate |
| Consider the full compensation package | Focus only on base salary |
| Prepare your mindset with rest, movement, and calm | Show up over-caffeinated or anxious |

## Example Transformations

| Before | After |
|--------|-------|
| “I think I worked on a similar project once…” | “In 2022, I led a cross-functional rollout for a $5M product line — let me walk you through my approach.” |
| “I’m open to any salary.” | “Could you share the range for this role? I want to make sure we’re aligned before moving forward.” |
| “I hope they like me.” | “I’m here to see if this company aligns with what I’m looking for, too.” |

## Hidden Insight
